# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This Hello World assignment was created using the MVC approach. The stack I used is: Node.js for my server, Express.js for my framework, EJS for my views, and Nodemon
for my dev tools. This displays "Hello World" in the browser, using my local host port of choice. I chose this method because I have been working on a few projects using
this same approach recently and thought it appropriate to use for this assignment.
