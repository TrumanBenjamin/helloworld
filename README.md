# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of your software}
This Hello World assignment was created using the MVC approach.  This displays "Hello World" in the browser, using my local host port of choice. I chose this method because I have been working on a few projects using
this same approach recently and thought it appropriate to use for this assignment. 

{Describe your purpose for creating this software.}
This software can be used to display information to the browser using the MVC approach. In this case, we kept it very simple and pushed a message, contained in our homeController file, to my EJS view for the home page to the browser. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

The stack I used is: Node.js for my server, Express.js for my framework, EJS for my views, and Nodemon for my dev tools.

I just used HTML and JS for this project. There was no styling added to this project, otherwise I would've used CSS.
